# Contributing Code to Project AQUA
Please read this guide befor euploading code to the Project AQUA repository.

## Uploading Arduino Code
When uploading Arduino code to the GitHub repository, **please ensure that any untested code is committed via a pull request.** This gives me (and everyone else) a chance to review the code and check for any bugs, errors, or other potential issues before committing the code to the master branch.

## Uploading Website Code
When uploading new website code, you may commit code to the master branch *if the changes are relatively minor or you are absolutely certain that the new code is compatible with all major browsers.*

"All major browsers" in this context refers to Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Chrome.

If you're unsure whether some new web code is compatible with those three browsers, or if a significant amount of untested code is being uploaded, start a pull request instead and the code will be reviewed and fixed if needed.

## Should This Code Be Directly Committed to Master?
If you're unsure as to whether it's safe to commit code to the master branch or not, assume **no**. It's better to spend time reviewing the code only to discover that it's safe than it is to upload broken code directly and run the risk of running into issues later on.
