/* This is an experimental JS file created in an attempt to fix the fact that footer is hovering mid-screen when data boxes are open.
 * How this fix (hopefully) works is it will instantly hide the data reading boxes when the page loads.
 * Obviously the ideal thing to do would be to have the data reading boxes hidden from the very beginning.
 * But if doing it this way works then I'm keeping it. Although there is a good chance that this will just end up being unused.
